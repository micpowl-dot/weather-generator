  "prompt": "Use the uploaded 'base_image' as the primary photograph and preserve all of its original composition, lighting, colors, and details. The 'base_image' contains a specific placeholder area intended for inserting graphics. Use the second uploaded image, referenced as 'graphic_ref', as the source for those graphics. IMPORTANT: The black background in the 'graphic_ref' image must NOT be included in any form. Remove, ignore, or treat the black background as fully transparent. Extract ONLY the visible graphic elements from 'graphic_ref' and composite them cleanly into the placeholder area of the 'base_image'. Match the perspective, scale, lighting, reflections, and angle of the placeholder so the inserted graphic appears naturally integrated. Do not alter any other parts of the 'base_image'. The final composite should look seamless and realistic.",
